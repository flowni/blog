Hi, cool that you are interested in my blog! 

Let us start with a few lines about myself so you know what to expect:

I am Nicholas, currently 27 years old and living in Augsburg, Germany (soon probably in Munich again). I've always loved building things on my computer, even though I often don't finish the projects, but hey, it's all about the fun and experiments during the process.

Currently (and the next few years), my full time job is working as CTO & Co-Founder at our Startup [SUMM AI](https://summ-ai.com) where we build the "Google Translate" for Easy Language (Leichte Sprache in German). So you enter a standard German text and receive an easy language version in a few seconds.

Besides that, I enjoy going for a run (while listening to podcasts) and drinking coffee.

I am very much interested in a lot of (technical) topics, but to name three:
- NLP
- Infrastructure / Cloud
- Startups

Ok, let this be enough for now.

Hopefully, I can share something useful for you. Much fun and feel free to reach out to me over my social channels in the footer.
